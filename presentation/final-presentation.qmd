## Introduction

-   **Problem**: Housing prices are often unfair and unaffordable

    ```{r}
    knitr::include_graphics("Images/HousingVsWages.png")

    ```

-   **Current Policy**: Fair Market Rent (FMR) is used to determine housing prices

    -   Problem is that it only looks at a narrow portion of what influences housing prices

-   **Goal**: Analyze the difference between FMR and actual housing prices to identify areas of unfair housing prices

## Methods

-   **Data**: 100k apartments for Rent Classified Dataset
-   **Data**: FMR Dataset
-   **Analysis**:
    -   **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze correlations between variables and create a basic linear model
    -   **Random Forest**: Predict housing prices based on bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and population
    -   **Geographically Weighted Regression**: Predict housing prices based on bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and population
-   **Model Choice**: GWR was chosen because it accounts for spatial autocorrelation which was crucial in our understanding of how the covariates vary over space
    -   Use the Simulation study as proof

## Results

-   **Insert Plots here**
-   **Show where in the US we see our greatest discrepancies**
-   **The validity of our results**

## Discussion

-   **What do our results mean?**
-   **Why are some areas more unfair than others?**![](Images/New%20York%20City.jpg){width="161"}![](Images/San%20Fran.jpg){width="166"}![](Images/Denver.jpg){width="176"}![](Images/Miami.jpg){width="135"}
    -   New York City, Western Coast, Colorado, Miami
-   **How can we use this information to make housing more affordable?**
    -   Information can be used to pinpoint

## Conclusion

-   We see in the aforementioned areas that there are other factors that the FMR cannot capture

-   **Moving forward, what can we do to improve upon our research**
