abstract: |
  The fair market rent (FMR) system in the United States is used by the Department of Housing to ascertain what housing should cost in any given county based on economic factors, however reality often does not reflect this estimate as other factors push the cost of housing higher. Fair Market Rent Difference is an analysis technique that leverages Random Forests in order to find where in the United States there is a large difference between the FMR and the actual market rent. With Random Forests, we are able to accurately create a predictive field that shows these disparities and what areas they are formed in. The analysis will allow for a broad overlook of how housing unaffordability fluctuates with respect to space when it is compared to a price point that is based on the economic data of the county. This analysis can be a baseline for future research into market conditions that drive regions of the US to have tighter housing demands than expected by the government to then enact policy for housing affordability in unsuspecting places.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Motivation
Rent pricing and how unaffordability is a big problem
The United States is infamous for its housing unaffordability crisis (insert source here) however with the government spending upwards of 216 Billion under the Department of Housing and Urban Development there has to be a way to solve this problem. 


Domain
We believe that the Fair Market Rent system (FMR) that the government is using can be improved upon to incorporate live housing stock data to make better inferences on where in the United States housing unaffordability is. 

Discover
Currently the Fair Market Rent system relies on a multitude of factors which mainly includes economic factors like household wealth and GDP per capita within counties to find a 40th percentile price for what can be affordable housing for 60% of the population within a certain area. This system will then allocate housing units at those determined prices to push down the price of rent in those markets or allow for vouchers to be used to live in those areas. The main issue that is found is that market rent can vary wildly from year to year for reasons other than the economic wellbeing of the community as told by (insert source). 


Thesis
A metric that compares the difference between market rent and Fair Market Rent can capture more housing unaffordability data than either data set can do alone.

# Methods
The dataset on rent prices was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository and contained roughly 52,000 observations after removing observations that were incomplete or were outside the contiguous United States. This was then aggregated into county level data which left data on 986 counties across the United States. To aggregate, the mean response of each covariate for all the observations in that county was used. From *figure showing responses* it is apparent that there are spatial effects in this data. 

To model this spatial effect, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used. GWR assumes that the covariates are changing with space and each observation is influenced by the observations closest around it. To do this a regression model is fit for each individual observation using a weight matrix that is a function of the distance between observations. 

This fits our needs as the rent pricing is varying with space and it can be seen that counties near to each other are closer in price than those farther out. 

# Results

# Discussion
Since we donâ€™t have real results to talk about right now we can go over a brief overview of the EDA such as the coast being more unaffordable than the rest of the nation 
Discuss modeling efficiency 
How these disparities can be used to provide better policy
