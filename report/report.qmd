# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This is an example of how to use this template to render journal articles. This template is inspired by the arXiv rticles template for rmarkdown, repurposed for the Quarto publishing system.

This quarto extension format supports PDF and HTML outputs. This template is primarily focused on generating acceptable {{< latex >}} outputs from Quarto, but renders an acceptable HTML output using the standard Quarto options.

# Methods
The dataset on rent prices was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository and contained roughly 52,000 observations after removing observations that were incomplete or were outside the contiguous United States. This was then aggregated into county level data which left data on 986 counties across the United States. To aggregate, the mean response of each covariate for all the observations in that county was used. From *figure showing responses* it is apparent that there are spatial effects in this data. 

To model this spatial effect, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used. GWR assumes that the covariates are changing with space and each observation is influenced by the observations closest around it. To do this a regression model is fit for each individual observation using a weight matrix that is a function of the distance between observations. 

This fits our needs as the rent pricing is varying with space and it can be seen that counties near to each other are closer in price than those farther out.

# Citations

This section of the template is adapted from the [Quarto citation documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).

Quarto supports bibliography files in a wide variety of formats including BibTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the `bibliography` YAML metadata field. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

See the [Pandoc Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) documentation for additional information on bibliography formats.

## Citation Syntax {#sec-citations}

Quarto uses the standard Pandoc markdown representation for citations. Here are some examples:

You can also write in-text citations, as follows:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Markdown Format               | Output                        |
+===============================+===============================+
| ```                           | @knuth1984 says blah.         |
| @knuth1984 says blah.         |                               |
| ```                           |                               |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| ```                           | @knuth1984 [p. 33] says blah. |
| @knuth1984 [p. 33] says blah. |                               |
| ```                           |                               |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

See the [Pandoc Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) documentation for additional information on citation syntax.

To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the `csl` metadata field in your document, for example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
csl: nature.csl
---
```
