	abstract = {Purpose Accounting for locational effects in determining price is of fundamental importance. The demise of the mainstream property market has culminated in increasing appetite and investment activity within the private rental sector. The primary purpose of this paper aims to analyse the local variation and spatial heterogeneity in residential rental prices in a large urban market in the {UK} using various geo-statistical approaches. Design/methodology/approach Applying achieved price data derived from a leading internet-based rental agency for Belfast Northern Ireland is analysed in a number of spatially based modelling frameworks encompassing more traditional approaches such as hedonic regressive models to more complex spatial filtering methods to estimate rental values as a function of the properties implicit characteristics and spatial measures. Findings The principal findings show the efficacy of the geographically weighted regression ({GWR}) technique as it provides increased accuracy in predicting marginal price estimates relative to other spatial techniques. The results reveal complex spatial non-stationarity across the Belfast metropole emphasizing the premise of location in determining and understanding rental market performance. A key finding emanating from the research is that the high level of segmentation across localised pockets of the Belfast market, as a consequence of socio-political conflict and ethno-religious territoriality segregation, requires further analytical insight and model specification in order to understand the exogenous spatial and societal effects/implications for rental value. Originality/value This study is one of only a few investigations of spatial residential rent price variation applying the {GWR} methodology, spatial filtering and other spatial techniques within the confines of a {UK} housing market. In the context of residential rent prices, the research highlights that a soft segmentation modelling approaches are essential for understanding rental gradients in a polarised ethnocratic city.},

We show that the in-sample fit and cross-validation prediction accuracy improve significantly when we account for spatial heterogeneity. In particular, for one-day-ahead forecasts, the spatiotemporal autoregressive ({STAR}) model demonstrates its superiority over model specifications with alternating spatial and temporal heterogeneity and dependence structures. In addition, sub-market fixed effects, constructed on the basis of statistical {TREE} methods, improve the results of predefined local rental markets further.},

	abstract = {High-resolution spatiotemporal wind speed mapping is useful for atmospheric environmental monitoring, air quality evaluation and wind power siting. Although modern reanalysis techniques can obtain reliable interpolated surfaces of meteorology at a high temporal resolution, their spatial resolutions are coarse. Local variability of wind speed is difficult to capture due to its volatility. Here, a two-stage approach was developed for robust spatiotemporal estimations of wind speed at a high resolution. The proposed approach consists of geographically weighted ensemble machine learning (Stage 1) and downscaling based on meteorological reanalysis data (Stage 2). The geographically weighted machine learning method is based on three base learners, which are an autoencoder-based deep residual network, {XGBoost} and random forest, and it incorporates spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity to boost the ensemble predictions. With reanalysis data, downscaling was introduced in Stage 2 to reduce bias and spatial abrupt (non-natural) variation in the predictions inferred from Stage 1. The autoencoder-based residual network was used in Stage 2 to adjust the difference between the averages of the fine-resolution predicted values and the coarse-resolution reanalysis data to ensure consistency. Using mainland China as a case study, the geographically weighted regression ({GWR}) ensemble predictions were shown to perform better than individual learners’ predictions (with an approximately 12–16\% improvement in R2 and a decrease of 0.14–0.19 m/s in root mean square error). Downscaling further improved the predictions by reducing inconsistency and obtaining better spatial variation (smoothing). The proposed approach can also be applied for the high-resolution spatiotemporal estimation of other meteorological parameters or surface variables involving remote sensing images (i.e. reliable coarsely resolved data), ground monitoring data and other relevant factors.},

The equilibrium price–rent ratio, however, assumes that the sold and rented dwellings being compared are of equal quality, which is typically not the case. Using hedonic methods applied to prices and rents for 730,000 houses in Sydney, Australia, we find that quality-adjusting reduces the actual price–rent ratio by on average 18\%. Failure to make such a correction therefore will seriously bias the results towards a finding that the price–rent ratio is above its equilibrium level. We also explore ways of imputing the expected capital gain – a key input into the equilibrium price–rent ratio formula, and show that price–rent ratios (both actual and equilibrium) vary in systematic ways over the housing distribution. This latter result implies that it is not enough to simply focus on the median, as different results may pertain for other quantiles.},

	abstract = {Access to affordable housing has been a long-standing issue for households in most cities. This paper reports on a study of house rent prices in Port Moresby, factors influencing them, and affordability of the prices. Data was obtained from houses that were advertised for rent in Port Moresby for a period of 13 months and were analysed using the ordinary least squares ({OLS}) regression model. The results show that monthly house rent prices range from 2357 to 34,286 Papua New Guinea Kina ({PGK}), or 714 to 10,389 U.S. dollars ({USD}), and the median price was 7286 {PGK} (2208 {USD}). Houses located in the central business district had the highest median house rent price, whereas low-income areas had the lowest rent price. By dividing the median house rent price by gross household income, the housing affordability index was 3.4. House rent price was influenced by factors such as number of bedrooms and location. To make house rent prices more affordable for Port Moresby residents, it is necessary to supply more houses for rent relative to demand, especially in low-income areas. Relevant governmental agencies should put more effort toward unlocking more customarily-owned land for housing development and toward facilitating the private sector to construct more low-cost houses for rent, which are affordable for low to middle income households. This has the potential of improving Port Moresby residents’ access to affordable houses for rent. The findings could assist urban development managers and planners in allocating resources for housing by considering housing demand, supply, and house rent prices.},

Third, nonparametric estimation is discussed; it contains several aspects of model choice, such as the choice of the estimator to use and the selection of tuning parameters. Fourth, model averaging approaches are reviewed in which estimators from different models are weighted to provide one final estimator. There are several ways to choose the weights, and most of them result in data-driven, hence random, weights.

When comparing observably similar housing units in the two submarkets, how expensive is rental housing relative to owner-occupied housing? This comparison matters both to families and to policymakers, who must decide how to allocate limited funding for affordable housing programs. We apply matching techniques to American Housing Survey data from 2017 and 2021, finding that rental units tend to be more expensive than physically similar owner-occupied units. Accounting for the portion of mortgage payments that constitutes savings, renters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region pay at least an extra \$143 per month, or 9.4 percent of their housing costs. Among the metro areas contained in our data, the Twin Cities feature a rental premium towards the lower end of the range.},

In contrast, the machine learning-based approach utilizes typical models: extreme gradient boosting ({XGBoost}), random forest ({RF}), and deep neural network ({DNN}). The out-of-sample prediction accuracy of these models was compared using Japanese apartment rent data, with a varying order of sample sizes (i.e., n = 104, 105, 106). The results showed that, as the sample size increased, {XGBoost} and {RF} outperformed {NNGP} with higher out-of-sample prediction accuracy. {XGBoost} achieved the highest prediction accuracy for all sample sizes and error measures in both logarithmic and real scales and for all price bands if the distribution of rents is similar in training and test data.

I find the {SAFMRs} will increase the number of listings below {FMR} in high-opportunity neighborhoods across each area studied except San Francisco. I confirm Oakland housing authorities' concerns that the {SAFMRs} would reduce the number of units below {FMR} in areas with rapidly rising rents. I find that Sacramento and San Diego may benefit most from the {SAFMRs} among those studied. These findings validate {HUD}'s criteria for identifying areas in which to implement the {SAFMRs}, as Sacramento and San Diego are also the only two areas among the case studies in this article that {HUD} initially approved for {SAFMRs} implementation.

Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {Determining real estate market dynamics has become an important issue in the city economy for achieving sustainable urban land management and investment planning. This study aims to determine the potential influencing factors of housing prices through applying global regression models including Ordinary Least Squares ({OLS}), Spatial Lag Model ({SLM}), and Spatial Error Model ({SEM}) and to examine their geographic variation by local regression approaches such as Geographically Weighted Regression ({GWR}) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression ({MGWR}). Pendik district of Istanbul (Turkey) was selected as study area. For these purposes, a case geodatabase was created with twenty-eight attributes: structural, geographic, and neighbourhood variables. Initially, nine significant variables used as input in the other models were selected with a stepwise {OLS} approach. The modelling results suggested that local models achieve better performance in comparison to global models. Furthermore, local model factor coefficients and local R2 values were mapped for nine variables. Geographic variations of these variables with regards to housing price were analysed for {GWR} and {MGWR} models. This study provides a comprehensive methodology for the real estate market and city authorities to understand the geographic variations of factors affecting the real estate market in urban geography.},

	abstract = {Visualizing and interpreting regression coefficients from spatially varying coefficient models, such as geographically weighted regression ({GWR}), can be challenging, given the amount of information the models provide the spatial analyst. Adding to the visualization dilemma are various diagnostic tools for checking the coherence of the model. One such diagnostic tool is based on decomposing the regression coefficient variance matrix to test for collinearity, which is relevant because previous research has shown that collinearity in {GWR} can lead to estimated regression coefficients for multiple regression terms that are strongly correlated with each other. In this paper, visualization tools, such as linked scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots, and maps, are presented for diagnosing correlation in estimated regression coefficients that can be problematic for statistical inference of relationships between variables. These tools help explain patterns of dependence between regression terms apparent in scatter plots of estimated coefficients and link the structure in the scatter plots to locational information in a map. Visualization of this information should aid in the typical spatially varying coefficient model estimation process. A case study of census undercount in Franklin County, Ohio is presented as an illustrative example of applying the visual diagnostic approach in a {GWR} analysis.},
